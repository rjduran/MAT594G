f2011 - Introduction to Realistic Image Synthesis
Photo-realistic, synthetic images have become ubiquitous in films, television, print, and digital media. A wide variety of algorithms are used to generate these images, and many of them are custom-designed to capture very specific visual phenomena. We will survey these techniques in this course from a phenomenological perspective. Starting from specific visual phenomena that we would like to capture, e.g. the appearance of human skin, brushed metal, or shafts of light piercing a through a cloud, we will examine how existing algorithms synthesize these phenomena effectively and efficiently.  

Final uses Processing 1.5.1  

f2012 - Advanced Computer Graphics - GLSL, Renderman, ODE  
This course will cover advanced computer graphics topics in rendering, animation, and modeling. Topics may include, but are not limited to: programmable shading, General- Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, rigid body dynamics, OpenCL programming, physically based animation, subdivision surfaces, shadow algorithms, character skinning methods, ambient occlusion, and fractal growth algorithms.
